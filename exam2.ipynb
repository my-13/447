The startup has been slow to bring a product to market, and investors are getting anxious -- it is critically important that the team brings a product to market before summer.\n","\n","Your project manager has made the following design decisions / specifications:\n","\n","- the rider will specify a reference velocity r using a smartphone app;\n","\n","- the scooter will measure its velocity $\\dot{p}$;\n","\n","- your controller will determine the torque command $\\tau$ for motors attached to the wheels.\n","\n","Before your boss will let you touch (i.e. conduct experiments with) the physical hardware, you must synthesize and analyze your controller using a simulation model.
